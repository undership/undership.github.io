# Underships
_A pointless website listing tons of cringe Undertale ships._

**CURRENT SHIP COUNT:** 45

### About
As the name and description suggest, this website was built for the purpose of listing every _Undertale_ ship concerning any of the 10 main characters (I am thinking of expanding the site to include mini-bosses, as soon as I calculate how many ships that is and what the definition of a mini-boss is). Why, you ask? Well... _Because I goddamn feel like it, that's what!_

### How to Use
The ships are sorted by ID, Ship Name, Portmanteau, and Rating.

- Shipping ID is the Character IDs of the characters.
- Shipping Name is the names of the characters seperated by an "x".
- Shipping Portmanteau is the fused names of the characters.
- Shipping Rating is my personal rating out of 5 for the ship. **Do not get triggered over it.**
